Data analysis project on the Indian start-up ecosystem over a period from 2018 to 2021

# Title
### EXPLORING THE DYNAMIC REALM OF INDIA'S STARTUP ECOSYSTEM: A DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT

## Project Description
The Indian start-up ecosystem has observed remarkable growth and acquired significant attention in recent years. Funding plays a pivotal role in driving the growth and success of start-ups, enabling them to scale their operations, foster innovation, and create a lasting impact. Therefore, the aim of this "Indian Start-up Funding Analysis" project is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the funding landscape for start-ups in India from 2018 to 2021. By analyzing the funding data, the project seeks to uncover trends, patterns, and factors influencing start-up funding in India. 

A strong hypothesis was formulated and a series of questions to guide our analysis and drive actionable insights. These questions covered various aspects such as overall funding trends, sector-wise funding distribution, top investors and distribution of headquarters locations over the analyzed period.

## Project Approach
The project adopted the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework which is a widely used methodology for guiding data mining and data analysis projects. It provides a structured approach to tackling complex data-related problems and ensures that all relevant steps are taken to achieve meaningful results. 

### Data Description
